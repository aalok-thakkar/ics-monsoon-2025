# Introduction to Computer Science (ICS) - Monsoon 2025

## Overview
This introductory course offers a foundation in computational thinking as a powerful, structured approach to problem-solving. It is built around one uncompromising standard: correctness. Students will explore the core principles of computation and gain familiarity with key subdisciplines in the field. Working both with and without code, students will learn to design, analyze, and refine solutions with attention to correctness, clarity, and style. The course is anchored in two fundamental computational models: the functional model, which treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, and the imperative model, which views it as a sequence of state-changing instructions. More details are available on the course webpage.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Develop the ability to analyze and design algorithms as systematic problem-solving approaches, with an emphasis on precision and efficiency.

2. **Program Correctness and Design**: Understand the theoretical principles of program correctness, as well as design principles that emphasize clarity, structure, and style in solutions.

3. **Computational Models**: Explore computation through two core paradigms, the functional model (evaluation of mathematical functions) and the imperative model (state manipulation via sequences of instructions).

4. **Practical Coding Skills**: Gain hands-on experience coding in OCaml, with opportunities to explore other languages such as Python, Rust, Java, and Datalog.

5. **Foundational Disciplinary Topics**: Acquire an introductory understanding of subfields such as information theory, cryptography, compiler design, databases, numerical algorithms, quantitative modeling, and machine learning.

## Requirements (Reading List and other materials)
1. Introduction to Computer Science, Online Lecture Notes, Subhashis Banerjee and S. Arun-Kumar
2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, MIT Press.
3. How to Solve it by Computer, R. G. Dromey.
4. The Science of Programming, David Gries.

## Attendance
Excused absence(s) are not applicable in this course lecture.
Additional excused absence(s) are not applicable for sportspersons in this course lecture.

### Additional Comments:
Regular attendance is essential to succeed in this course. Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. However, the following accommodations are made:

- **No-Questions-Asked Absences**: Each student is allowed up to three no-questions-asked absences for any reason (e.g., illness, personal matters, emergencies). No documentation is required for these absences.

- **Sports-Related Absences**: Students representing the university may be granted up to three additional excused absences per semester, subject to OAA policy. The student must submit an accommodation request at least two weeks in advance to the Department of Sports and Office of Student Life. The request must be verified and forwarded to the Director of the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) at least one week before the intended absence. Any exceptions to the rules must be approved by the Dean of Academic Affairs.

- **Exam Absences**: If a student misses an exam for any reason, there will not be a make-up assessments. Instead, at the instructor's discretion, the weight of the missed exam may be redistributed across other graded components or the instructor may conduct a viva.

- **Unexcused absences**: Beyond the total excused absences, any additional absences will be penalized. Penalties may include grade reductions at the discretion of the instructor.
