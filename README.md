# Introduction to Computer Science (ICS) - Monsoon 2025

## Overview
This introductory course offers a foundation in computational thinking as a powerful, structured approach to problem-solving. It is built around one uncompromising standard: correctness. Students will explore the core principles of computation and gain familiarity with key subdisciplines in the field. Working both with and without code, students will learn to design, analyze, and refine solutions with attention to correctness, clarity, and style. The course is anchored in two fundamental computational models: the functional model, which treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, and the imperative model, which views it as a sequence of state-changing instructions. More details are available on the course webpage.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Develop the ability to analyze and design algorithms as systematic problem-solving approaches, with an emphasis on precision and efficiency.

2. **Program Correctness and Design**: Understand the theoretical principles of program correctness, as well as design principles that emphasize clarity, structure, and style in solutions.

3. **Computational Models**: Explore computation through two core paradigms, the functional model (evaluation of mathematical functions) and the imperative model (state manipulation via sequences of instructions).

4. **Practical Coding Skills**: Gain hands-on experience coding in OCaml, with opportunities to explore other languages such as Python, Rust, Java, and Datalog.

5. **Foundational Disciplinary Topics**: Acquire an introductory understanding of subfields such as information theory, cryptography, compiler design, databases, numerical algorithms, quantitative modeling, and machine learning.

## Requirements (Reading List and other materials)
1. Introduction to Computer Science, Online Lecture Notes, Subhashis Banerjee and S. Arun-Kumar
2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, MIT Press.
3. How to Solve it by Computer, R. G. Dromey.
4. The Science of Programming, David Gries.
