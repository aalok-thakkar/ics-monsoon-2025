(* Lecture 5: Division is Repeated Subtraction *)










(* We saw two different algorithms for exponentiation: *)

let rec exp (base : int) (power : int) : int =
  match power with
  | 0 -> 1
  | _ when power < 0 -> raise (Invalid_argument "exponent must be non-negative")
  | _ -> base * exp base (power - 1)



(* Let us introduce a new function T that tracks how much time it takes for the function exp. 

T(e) = time it takes to multiply + time it takes to compute (exp b (e - 1))
        = 1 + T(e - 1)
        = 1 + 1 + T(e - 2)
        = k + T(e - k)
        = e + T(e - e) = e + T(0) = e + 1
        
T(e) <= e + 1 = O(e)

So exp is linear in the power/exponent

*)

let rec pingala_exp (base : int) (power : int) : int =
  match power with
  | 0 -> 1
  | n when n < 0 -> raise (Invalid_argument "exponent must be non-negative")
  | n -> 
      let half = pingala_exp base (n/2) in
      match n mod 2 with
      | 0 -> half * half
      | _ -> base * half * half

(* Exercise: What if I consider base 3? *)









(* Let us introduce a new function T that tracks how much time it takes for the function pingala_exp. 

T(e) =   time it takes to compute half
       + time it takes to match 
       + time it takes to multiply

     <= T(e/2) + 4
      = (T(e/4) + 4) + 4
      = ((T(e/8) + 4)) + 4) + 4
      = ... 
      = T(e/(2^k)) + 4k
      = T(e/(2^ log_2 e)) + 4*log_2 e
      = T(1) + 4*log_2 e
      <= 10 + 4*log_2 e
      = O(log e)
  
      Let us say T(1) <= some constant (like 10)

*)


(* Let's compare their performance: *)


let time_function (f : int -> int -> int) (x : int) (y : int) : float =
  let start_time = Sys.time () in
  let _ = f x y in
  let end_time = Sys.time () in
  end_time -. start_time

let () =
  Printf.printf "exp (simple recursive):\n";
  let t1 = time_function exp 3 500 in
  Printf.printf "runtime: %f seconds\n\n" t1;
  Printf.printf "pingala_exp (Pingala's method):\n";
  let t2 = time_function pingala_exp 3 500 in
  Printf.printf "runtime: %f seconds\n\n" t2

(* The simple recursive version is O(n) as it makes n recursive calls.
   Pingala's method is O(log n) as it halves the power each time. *)


(* 

Proof that pingala_exp is O(log n):

   Let T(n) be the number of recursive calls made by pingala_exp for power n.
   
   For even n:
   T(n) = 1 + T(n/2)    [1 call plus recursion on n/2]
   
   For odd n: 
   T(n) = 1 + T((n-1)/2) [1 call plus recursion on (n-1)/2]
   
   In both cases, the next recursive call operates on roughly n/2.
   
   Starting with n, the sequence of values is approximately:
   n -> n/2 -> n/4 -> n/8 -> ... -> 1
   
   The number of steps to reach 1 is logâ‚‚(n).
   
   Therefore T(n) = O(log n).
   
   This matches our empirical timing results showing pingala_exp is much 
   faster than the O(n) simple recursive version for large powers.

(* Division is especially difficult to define correctly. *)

(* Case Study VII: Pentium FDIV bug (1994)

    In 1994, a bug in the Pentium processor's floating-point division unit 
    caused incorrect results in some calculations. The bug was caused by a 
    hardware error in the division unit. The bug was not detected until 1996, 
    when it was discovered that the bug was causing incorrect results in some 
    calculations. 

    In particular, dividing 4,195,835 by 3,145,727 gave 1.33382
    instead of the correct result of 1.33373.

    Intel said it incurred "a $475 million pre-tax charge ... to recover 
    replacement and write-off of these microprocessors."

(* Case Study VIII: USS Yorktown (CG-48).

In 1996, the U.S. Navy's Smart Ship initiative, aiming to automate key key 
operations and cut crew costs by 10% and save an estimated $2.8 million annually, 
decided to use a Windows NT 4.0-based network to manage vital functions like 
navigation, engine monitoring, and fuel control. 

However, during maneuvers in 1997, a crew member input a zero into a database, 
triggering a division-by-zero error in the Remote Database Manager (RDM).  

Since other Smart Ship systems were dependent on RDM availability across the 
LAN, these other SMCS components including ones controlling the motor and 
propulsion machinery began to fail in a domino-like sequence until the ship 
stopped dead in the water.

(* For handling exceptions, we will use option types! Option types in OCaml 
represent values that may or may not be present. They are defined as 

    type 'a option = None | Some of 'a' 
    
    where 'a' is any type. This is useful for functions that may not return a valid 
result, such as division by zero.

(* What about the remainder? *)




(* But we need a quotient and a remainder. Let us first figure out how we can 
have a function that has two outputs. *)  

(* A tuple is a fixed-size collections of values. For example, a pair of values
written as (a, b), but tuples can have more elements, e.g., (a, b, c).

  Example: A pair of integers
    let p : int * int = (3, 4)

  Example: A triple of different types
    let t : int * string * bool = (42, "hello", true)

  Accessing tuple elements is usually done via pattern matching:
    let (x, y) = p in
    (* x = 3, y = 4 *) 

*)

let min_max (a : int) (b : int) : int * int =
  match (a, b) with
  | (x, y) when x < y -> (a, b)
  | _ -> (b, a)


(* Now we can define a function that returns both the quotient and the 
remainder of a division operation. *)
